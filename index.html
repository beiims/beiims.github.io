				<p>  SUMO! King of the hill - ON ICE!</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
				Okay, so it doesn't actually have any sumo wrestling. BUT, can you be the last
				standing on the ever shrinking ice? As the heat turns up the ring starts to melt and
				fall away, making it harder and harder to stay on! Be careful bumping in to each other, 
				you might get blasted! Choose a class, collect power-ups, and earn gems by sliding 
				into first place!

				<p>It's SNOW DAY! School's out and you and your friends are about to have the craziest
				snowball fight you can imagine.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
				Ball up some snow and throw it as fast as your blocky hands can manage. Snow Day is 
				a no-holds-barred arcade style shooter where you compete with your friends to be the 
				most unrelenting snowballer imaginable. Slide around cover, charge up massive powerballs
				icing whoever is unfortunate enough to be in the way, and collect power-ups that spawn 
				randomly across the map. What are you waiting for?
